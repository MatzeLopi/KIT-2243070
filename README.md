# Course Material for KIT-2243070
## Data based modeling and control
In this repo I track my results for the exercises of the KIT course on data based modeling and control.

The solutions are coded in python. To run and test them I rely on some data provided by the professor but the algorithms can generally run on any data if it is in a numpy compatible format.
The loading of the initial data only needs to be adepted.

If you have any questions, remarks or find erros in my code, feel free to open an issue!

Happy coding!
